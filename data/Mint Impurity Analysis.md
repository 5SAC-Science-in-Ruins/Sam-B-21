# Introduction

This supplementary report details the unsuccessful analysis of concentrations/impurities by mint. This analysis was intended to control for estimated typological date and thus arrive at baseline values of each metal for each mint. This would allow us to answer questions such as: which mint used the most lead?

# Method

Due to the analytical efficacy of combining all major non-silver metals into one single data series, questions regarding the impurities of alloys in different mints arise. By pure coincidence, the sample set contains two examples of each mint, so a rudimentary analysis can be performed to investigate this.

To simplify things and obtain still reasonable results, a basic linear correlation is assumed between the concentration of each metal and the estimated typological date of the coin. This enables the division of the concentration of a particular metal by the typological date to arrive at a baseline concentration of a particular metal for a given coin, controlling to remove the effects of its date. If this baseline were multiplied by some constant linear coefficient, we would arrive at the actual concentration of the relevant metal (assuming a simple linear correlation). As there are two examples of each mint, these were normalised and the mean of the two was taken to arrive at a baseline concentration of each metal for each mint. As these baseline values were all very small decimals, they were multipled by 1000 to arrive at reasonable adjusted baseline figures. Because these add to inconsistent values, these baselines were then each adjusted as a percentage of the composition of the whole coin (all controlled to remove the effects of date). It should be noted that these baseline percentages are (assuming a linear correlation) comparable across both mints and different metals.

# Results and Discussion

Upon completing an analysis of mint impurities controlled to remove the effects of typological date, we can reasonably compare the percentage concentrations of each major metal comprising each coin produced from a given mint across time.

It should be notes that this analysis assumes three critical things: that there is a linear correlation between typological date and actual XRF concentration values (which there is not), that the main factor impacting concentration percentages after typological date is mint/location (which cannot be tested with such a small dataset), and that these baseline concentrations of mints do not change over time (which would introduce another element of complexity into the analysis). The latter two cannot be tested with such a small dataset, though the first is provably untrue. However, to simplify analysis, it is treated as true for the purposes of this single section of the broader analysis of these coins.

Upon comparing the values derived from this analysis, it can be very clearly seen that there is a clear disparity between the copper and silver baselines, which have been inverted by time due to a lack of broader sample dates for each mint. For example, the two samples from the Roma mint were produced only three years apart. Thus, this analysis is too inaccurate for metals which comprise a major part of the coins. Due to the low baseline values and smaller differences between them, it is difficult to say as to whether or not these data are wholly or partially accurate for more minor metals (i.e. lead and tin), though analysis is attempted here.

From this analysis, we can see that tin was present most at the Roma mint and the least at Cyzicus, with Antioch in the middle. For lead, the trend is the exact opposite, with Cyzicus having the highest baseline concentration and Roma the lowest, Antioch again being in the middle.

This analysis failed completely, resulting in a dataset more strongly correlated to time than it initially was, though inverted. This failure to control for time was likely due to the small size of the dataset, and the inseparable connections between mint and time.

# Conclusion

This analysis failed to answer the questions it had been hoped to, and would be best repeated in future with a larger dataset.
