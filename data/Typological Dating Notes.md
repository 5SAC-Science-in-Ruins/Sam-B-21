- Fourth coin dating (WRONG!)
	- Ruler determined from https://www.tesorillo.com/aes/_anv/constantinus2_i.htm
	- Reverse identified from https://www.tesorillo.com/aes/195/195i.htm, reverse type is 195 with *ubertas* standing left holding balance and cornucopia
	- Mint mark given as TR at above source, confirmed to be Treveri mint from https://www.tesorillo.com/aes/_cec/cecas1.htm (wrong, Trier)
	- This emperor is Flavius Claudius Constantinus according to https://www.tesorillo.com/aes/_rev/constantinus2_i.htm
	- That's Constantine II according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_II_(emperor)
		- Ruled from 337-340, made Caesar in 317 (just after birth)
	- Then I have an RIC page: https://www.wildwinds.com/coins/ric/constantine_II/t.html
	- Just noticed the RIC reference to RIC VII Trier 335 on https://www.tesorillo.com/aes/195/195i.htm, but apparently not listed in RIC!
	- Mint definitely at Trier than Treveri
- First coin dating
	- Find in page 'CONCORDIA MILITVM' at https://www.wildwinds.com/coins/ric/maximianus/t.html, looking for anything with mintmark XXI and correct obverse legend
		- Noting that the coin actually has Î” in lower centre
		- RIC V 607, D then (definite)
		- Cyzicus mint
		- 293
	- Determining mint at https://www.tesorillo.com/aes/_cec/cecas1.htm
		- Apparently XXI is mark of value, so mint unknown then for coin this early?
	- http://numismatics.org/ocre/id/ric.5.dio.607 -- RIC V Diocletian 607
- Fifth coin dating
	- Possibly RIC 75bMule (https://www.wildwinds.com/coins/ric/otacilia_severa/t.html)
		- Ruling out RIC 119a because the obverse legend appears to be different
		- Very likely RIC 125c, has identical obverse/reverse lettering, perfect legends too ()
		- Ruling out RIC 128a because different posture of figure on reverse
		- Calling it as RIC 125c!
	- https://www.vcoins.com/en/stores/numiscorner/239/product/coin_otacilia_severa_antoninianus_247_roma__billon_ric125c/1482589/Default.aspx seems to confirm typology
		- Date 247
		- Mint Roma
	- https://department.monm.edu/classics/coins/data/id/ota/ota007.jpg image confirms typology
	- Calling date and mint!
	- http://numismatics.org/ocre/id/ric.4.ph_i.125C -- RIC IV Philip I 125C
- Sixth coin dating
	- Know it's using sharp (sun ray?) crown, hence looking for that on https://wildwinds.com/coins/ric/trajan_decius/t.html
		- https://wildwinds.com/coins/sear5/s9378.html has very close obverse, now know lettering (IMP C M Q TRAIANVS DECIVS AVG)
		- Looks like the reverse has Pannoniae (https://wildwinds.com/coins/ric/trajan_decius/RIC_0021a.jpg)
		- Based on https://wildwinds.com/coins/sear5/s9378.html I also want the radiate crown
			- That one is very similar but I don't think it's correct, minor discrepancies on reverse (RIC 21b for reference though)
		- Searching for IMP C M Q TRAIANVS DECIVS AVG, radiate seems to yield one of the above to be correct (24 results)
			- List of possible (correct lettering, radiate crown, Pannoniae): RIC 21b, RIC 25
		- Ruling out 25 because the right figure on the reverse golds a torch
		- Ruling out 21b because the right figures don't match completely (possible though)
	- https://www.vcoins.com/en/stores/victors_imperial_coins/208/product/trajan_decius_pannoniae_from_rome/1361541/Default.aspx is very similar, again 21b, but reverse not quite right, maybe a variant?
		- Doesn't have the staff-like object at the base of right figure, so maybe mine is 21b
		- https://www.vcoins.com/en/stores/aeternitas_numismatics/2/product/trajan_decius_ar_antoninianus_efef_pannoniae_excellent_coin/544997/Default.aspx does have that, but more generic Pannoniae
		- Probably 21b -- date range 249-251
		- http://numismatics.org/ocre/id/ric.4.tr_d.21B description of 21b matches, therefore calling it as RIC 21b
			- Lists mint as Roma
	- http://numismatics.org/ocre/id/ric.4.tr_d.21B -- RIC IV Trajan Decius 21B
- Fourth coin (take 2)
	- I now know that the emperor is Gordian III from Dr. Dearn's identification
		- Looking for it in https://wildwinds.com/coins/ric/gordian_III/t.html
		- Sir read obverse as IMP CAES M ANT GORDIANVS AVG, searching for that (and radiate) 'IMP CAES M ANT GORDIANVS AVG, radiate'
		- Sir has identified reverse as Aequitas (only 15 results, using that instead)
		- Possibly: RIC 34, RIC 177 (not certain that's radiate though)
			- All others are PIVS or the like
		- RIC 177 tentatively ruled out, different eye style, despite identical reverse
		- RIC 34 has very wrong nose style
		- Either could be it, but RIC 34 is 240 CE and RIC 177 is TODO
		- RIC 177a fits perfectly, though maybe with a slightly different facial expression on the eyes (possible new RIC variant!) https://wildwinds.com/coins/ric/gordian_III/RIC_0177a.jpg
		- Chose that over RIC 177 or 177a.1 due to the more accurate representation of the radiate crown
		- Date for 177a given on Wildwinds as 238-239 CE, confirmed by http://numismatics.org/ocre/id/ric.4.gor_iii.177
		- Mint also given as Antioch from both sources
	- http://numismatics.org/ocre/id/ric.4.gor_iii.177A -- RIC IV Gordian III 177A
- Second coin
	- Didn't initially date, information already given, should clarify though!
	- Using given RIC V Diocletian 322 (that last digit is in question...)
	- http://numismatics.org/ocre/id/ric.5.dio.322 matches perfectly!
	- Permits Z in reverse field, as this one has
	- Mint: Antioch
	- 293-295 AD
	- Examples available, they match too (http://numismatics.org/ocre/id/ric.5.dio.322#examples)
	- That also confirms it to be an antoninianus, in contradiction to given statement
	- http://numismatics.org/ocre/id/ric.5.dio.322 -- RIC V Diocletian 322
- Third coin
	- Stuffed up, 356 is RIC reference, not date!
	- Wildwinds Aurelian doesn't have it
	- URl playing around on Numismatic.org! http://numismatics.org/ocre/id/ric.5.aur.356
	- 5 year date range, which is bad (270-275), I'll try to narrow that down
	- Searching for that date range on Wildwinds at https://www.wildwinds.com/coins/ric/aurelian/t.html yields nothing
	- No other sources found unfortunately, not a common coin perhaps
	- Mint is Cyzicus
	- http://numismatics.org/ocre/id/ric.5.aur.356 -- RIC V Aurelian 356
