The joint use of Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy allowed for an accurate determination of the coins' elemental composition; the measurements, performed mostly in situ at the ‘Monetiere’ in Florence, revealed a striking connection between the ‘quality’ of the silver alloy and some crucial contemporary events. This finding was used to classify a group of denarii whose dating was otherwise impossible. The comparison with other contemporary denarii disproves a recent theory on the origin of the so called ‘serrated’ denarii (denarii showing notched chisel marks on the edge of the coin).},

	abstract = {Determination of the microchemistry of surface corrosion layers on ancient silver alloy coins is important both in terms of understanding the nature of archaeological environmental conditions to which these ancient coins were exposed and also to help in their conservation. In this present study, five ancient silver alloy coins (225 BCE–244 CE) were used as test vehicles to measure their immediate surface microchemistry and evaluate the appropriateness and limitations of High Sensitivity-Low Energy Ion Scattering Spectroscopy (HS-LEIS, 0.3nm depth analysis), High Resolution-X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (HR-XPS, 1–3nm depth analysis) and High Resolution-Raman Spectroscopy (HR-Raman, ∼1000nm depth analysis). Additional information about the deeper corrosion layers, up to ∼300–1000nm, was provided by dynamic HS-LEIS and HR-Raman spectroscopy. While not archeologically significant, the use of these coins of small commercial value provides data that is more representative of the weaker signals typically obtained from ancient corroded objects, which can be in stark contrast to pristine data often obtained from carefully prepared alloys of known composition. The oldest coins, from 225 to 214 BCE, possessed an outermost surface layer containing Cu2O, Na, Al, Pb, and adsorbed hydrocarbons, while the more recent coins, from 98 to 244 CE, contained Cu2O, Ag, N, F, Na, Al, S, Cl, and adsorbed hydrocarbons in similar corresponding surface layers. It thus appears that alloying with copper, even in small amounts, leads to the formation of an outer Cu2O layer. Depth profiling revealed the presence of K, Na, Cl, and S as key corrosion components for both sets of coins with S, most likely as Ag2S, concentrated towards the surface while the Cl, most likely as AgCl, penetrated deeper. Schema to understand the overall chemistry of the corrosion layers present on these silver alloy coins were developed from the equipment limitations encountered and are presented.},

	abstract = {The basic silver coin of the Roman Empire was the denarius. By decree of Caesar Augustus in 15 b.c.e, It was nearly pure silver, 95–98\%, and had a fixed weight and value in relationship to the rest of the Roman monetary system. Over the next 270 years, the silver content of the denarius declined gradually and then precipitously to about 2\%. This degradation occurred more rapidly in the provinces than in Rome. The microstructures of a series of Roman denarii taken from thi stime period are used to illustrate these changes. The final stage of the denarius was a duplex plated coin with a neatly copper core and a silver surface. This produced a lower-cost coin with an apparent value equal to the previous ones. Eventually, the surface coating was so thin that it quickly rubbed off after the coin left the mint. By this time (280 c.e.), the silver coinage of the empire had almost totally lost its value and had to be reconstituted by Diocletion. Among the coins studied is an early duplex plated denarius of Caesar Augustus, probably an early forgery produced during his lifetime in clear violation of his edict.},

Indeed, there is hardly anything produced by knowledgeable numismatists that is easily accessible to the academic community at large or the interested lay reader. The Oxford Handbook of Greek and Roman Coinage will fill this gap by providing a systematic overview of the major coinages of the classical world. The Handbook begins with a general introduction by volume editor William E. Metcalf followed by an article establishing the history and role of scientific analysis in ancient numismatics. The subsequent thirty-two chapters, all written by an international group of distinguished scholars, cover a vast geography and chronology, beginning with the first evidence of coins in Western Asia Minor in the seventh century BCE and continuing up to the transformation of coinage at the end of the Roman Empire. In addition to providing the essential background and current research questions of each of the major coinages, the Handbook also includes articles on the application of numismatic evidence to the disciplines of archaeology, economic history, art history, and ancient history. With helpful appendices, a glossary of specialized terms, indices of mints, persons, and general topics, and nearly 900 illustrations, The Oxford Handbook of Greek and Roman Coinage will be an indispensable resource for scholars and students of the classical world, as well as a stimulating reference for collectors and interested lay readers.},

	abstract = {The antoninianus, or pre-reform radiate, was a coin used during the Roman Empire thought to have been valued at 2 denarii. It was initially silver, but was slowly debased to bronze with a minimal silver content. The coin was introduced by Caracalla in early 215 AD. It was silver, similar to the denarius except that it was slightly larger and featured the emperor wearing a radiate crown, indicating it was a double denomination. Antoniniani depicting women (usually the emperor's wife) featured the bust resting upon a crescent moon.Even at its introduction, the silver content of the antoninianus was only equal to 1.5 denarii. This created inflation: People rapidly hoarded the denarii (Gresham's law), while both buyers and sellers recognized the new coin had a lower intrinsic value and elevated their prices to compensate. Silver bullion supplies began running short because the Roman Empire was no longer conquering new territory, the Iberian silver mines had been exhausted, and a series of soldier emperors and usurpers needed coin to pay their troops and buy their loyalty. Each new issue of the antoninianus thus had less silver in it than the last, and thus contributed to ever-increasing inflation.
In 271 AD Aurelian increased the average weight of the antoninianus, this change lasting for only a short time. Around this time, the enigmatic 'XXI' was first marked on the reverse of the antoninianus. The true meaning of this series of numbers is still a topic of debate, but is thought to represent a 20:1 silver ratio (4.76\% silver, which may originally have been 5\%, if worn-away silver enrichment on the surface is allowed for).
By the late 3rd century AD, antoniniani were almost entirely made of bronze reclaimed from melted-down older issues like the sestertius. Vast quantities were minted, with a large percentage of the circulating stock being contemporary forgeries, often with blundered legends and designs. Individual coins were by then practically worthless, and were lost or discarded by the millions. The resultant situation was not unlike the hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic in 1920s Germany, when paper money was printed in reckless abundance. The coin ceased to be used by the end of the 3rd century, when a series of monetary reforms attempted to arrest the decline by issuing new coinage.

Today most of these coins are extremely common finds, with a few scarcer examples including Aemilianus, Marcus Aurelius Marius, Quietus, and Regalianus. 
Modern numismatists use "antoninianus" because it is not known what it was called in antiquity. An ancient Roman document called the Historia Augusta (of generally low reliability) refers to silver coins named after an Antoninus on several occasions (several Roman emperors in the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries bore this name). Because Caracalla's silver coin was a new issue, and he had taken Antoninus as part of his imperial name, an association (though likely false) was made with it, and the name stuck.},

A comparison of the fineness and weight of imperial silver coinage with ancient sources which describe the changing role of argentam and nummularii, the primary institutions for currency exchange and assay, reveals several important differences between the reaction to currency manipulations of the central government in the mid- to late second century as compared with those pursued almost a century later. However, if the value of imperial currency was partly or wholly related to its acceptability to coin-users, then the abundance or paucity of information from contemporary monetary experts may have had considerable influence upon the potential for wider economic crisis. A case can be made that this is what happened in the third century: in the face of increased efforts to secure over-valuation of currency, independent exchanges and assayers were crowded out of local markets. Changes to monetary institutions and their role within the monetary system of the Late Principate, may also help explain why the kinds of economic consequences which seem to have characterised the third century were not produced earlier.},
